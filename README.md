## [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu)
A class that covers the shell, text editing, data wrangling, version control, remote/virtual machines, security, and more. 
> "Students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make studentsâ€™ lives significantly easier."
* [2020 Lectures](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/)
  * [Course overview + the shell, Shell Tools and Scripting](), [Editors (Vim)](), [Data Wrangling](), [Command-line Environment](), [Version Control (Git)](), [Debugging and Profiling](), [Metaprogramming (build systems, dependency management, testing, CI), Security and Cryptography](), [Potpourri](), [Q&A]()
