My DevOps & Site Reliability Engineering Learning Path

## Introduction
**What is a DevOps Engineer?** - [How a DevOps engineer facilitates DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops/devops-engineer)  
**What is Site Reliability Engineering?**: 
> "Fundamentally, it's what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function" - [Ben Treynor Sloss](https://sre.google/in-conversation/)  
> "In general, an SRE team is responsible for the availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their service(s)" - [Site Reliability Engineering - Chapter 1: Introduction](https://sre.google/sre-book/introduction/)  
> "Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) are Software Engineers specializing in reliability. SREs apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design, development and operation of computer systems: generally, large scale, distributed ones" - [School of SRE](https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/)

## Data Structures & Algorithms (Python)
List, dictionary, stack, queue, deque, linked list, recursion, sorting, searching, tree, graph.
* [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html#)  
* [LeetCode (easy)](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=Easy)

## [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu)
A class that covers the shell, text editing, data wrangling, version control, remote/virtual machines, security, and more. 
> "Students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make studentsâ€™ lives significantly easier."

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
> "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the approach of automating infrastructure deployment and changes by defining the desired resource states and their mutual relationships in code." - [Savic](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/infrastructure-as-code-explained)  
> "That really becomes the value. It's really the versioning of it, the reusability of the code, and the ability to then do automation on top of it." [Armon Dadgar](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)  
> "'infrastructure as code' is the answer to managing large-scale, distributed systems, cloud-native applications, and service-based architectures." - [Armon Dadgar](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)
